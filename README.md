# ~Robeats~OsuWebConvert2

A fork of @spotco's repository used for [https://www.roblox.com/games/698448212/Spring-RoBeats-Music-Rhythm-RPG](Robeats!)

## Unique Features

- Outputs scrolling speed data; it is useful for games that wish to have scrolling speed gimmicks.

- You can input Audio IDs from Roblox instead of editing manually in your output code.

- ^^ This is pretty much the reason I forked his.
